# Random-Forests
In this lesson, I explored the balance between underfitting and overfitting in decision trees and introduced the random forest model as a solution. Decision trees can either overfit with too much specificity or underfit with too little. Random forests address this by averaging predictions from multiple trees, providing better accuracy and robustness.
